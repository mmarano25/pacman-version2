ghosts 
	if ghost within distance, remove their direction from legal moveset. pick random available move. if adjacent move, pick it instead.
		perhaps if towards food prioritize?
food 
	seek closest food. pick direction towards food
corners
	if no ghosts and no food around, seek each corner subsequently. make a looping list?
	e.g. for nw corner, if n or w in legal moves, pick it. if not, then pick a random move.


functions to make: 
	direction(my_coord, dest_coord) -> SNWE
	backwardsDirection(SNWE) -> SNWE
